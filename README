# Initial Setup

Follow these steps in order to deploy from scratch.

## Traefik configuration

**If you anticipate the deployment will be unstable**, you must modify
`traefik.yaml` and uncomment the following line:

    # caServer: "https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"

If you do not do this, you will almost certainly hit a rate limit on the
official LetsEncrypt servers and be unable to issue certificates for a week.

## Network setup

The following network must be created for Traefik to be able to reach all
services. It must be created externally to Docker to ensure all services can
"see" it.

    docker network create --driver overlay --scope=swarm --attachable traefik_services

## Secrets

Generate new secrets:

    ./generate-secret.sh > secrets/keycloak_admin_password.txt
    ./generate-secret.sh > secrets/keycloak_pg_password.txt
    ./generate-secret.sh > secrets/terraform_postgres_backend_password.txt
    ./generate-secret.sh > secrets/gitea_postgres_password.txt

Generate a personal access token from https://gandi.net which has permissions to
manage DNS records, and store it in `secrets/gandi_api_key.txt.`

## Deployment

    ./build-images.sh && ./deploy-stacks.sh

## Services

### Traefik

- Visit `http://localhost:8080` and log into Keycloak using the credentials
  `admin` and the password in `secrets/keycloak_admin_password.txt`
- Create a new Client in the `master` realm. Name it `terraform` - set the
  client ID to `terraform` as well. Tick "Client authentication", and untick all
  Authentication flow boxes except for "Service account roles", which should be
  ticked.
- Assign the new client the `create-realm` and `admin` Service account roles.
- Copy the client secret from the Credentials panel. Create a new `.env` file at
  `terraform/.env` with the following values, replacing the client secret as
  appropriate:

### DNS, Keycloak and other Terraform

```
export PGUSER=terraform
export PGPASSWORD=$(cat ../secrets/terraform_postgres_backend_password.txt)
export PGSSLMODE=disable
export KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_ID=terraform
# This is pasted directly here because it is created by Keycloak rather than being managed by us.
export KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET="{{CLIENT SECRET GOES HERE}}"
export KEYCLOAK_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

- Execute `tofu apply` inside the terraform folder.
